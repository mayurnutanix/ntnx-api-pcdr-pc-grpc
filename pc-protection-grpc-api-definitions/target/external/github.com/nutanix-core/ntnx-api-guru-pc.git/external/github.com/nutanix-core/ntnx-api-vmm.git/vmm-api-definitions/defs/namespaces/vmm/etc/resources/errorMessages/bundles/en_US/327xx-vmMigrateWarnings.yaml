    Warning while migrating VM with UUID '{{{vm_uuid}}}' due to different source and
    target cluster High Availability configuration.

  errorGroup: MIGRATE_VM_WARNING
  severity: WARNING
  message: >
    Warning while migrating VM with UUID '{{{vm_uuid}}}' as one or more VM categories

  errorGroup: MIGRATE_VM_WARNING
  severity: WARNING
  message: >
    Warning while migrating VM with UUID '{{{vm_uuid}}}' because the target cluster
    with UUID '{{{target_cluster_uuid}}}' does not have a compliant host to honor
    the VM Host affinity policies.

  severity: WARNING
  message: >
    Warning while migrating VM with UUID '{{{vm_uuid}}}' because the target cluster
    with UUID '{{{target_cluster_uuid}}}' is not compliant with the storage
    policies associated with the VM.

  errorGroup: MIGRATE_VM_WARNING
  severity: WARNING
  message: >
    Warning while migrating VM with UUID '{{{vm_uuid}}}' because the data-at-rest
    encryption property is not honored on the target cluster with UUID
    '{{{target_cluster_uuid}}}'.

  errorGroup: MIGRATE_VM_WARNING
  severity: WARNING
  message: >
    Warning while migrating VM with UUID '{{{vm_uuid}}}' because VM is part of a legacy VM
    group with UUID '{{{vm_group_uuid}}}' meaning that the anti-affinity policies it
    is part of will not be automatically applied on target cluster after the migration.

  errorGroup: MIGRATE_VM_WARNING
  severity: WARNING
  message: >
    Warning while migrating VM with UUID '{{{vm_uuid}}}' on target cluster with UUID
    '{{{target_cluster_uuid}}}' because the Round-trip travel (RTT) to the target cluster is
    {{{rtt_ms}}} milliseconds and maximum allowed RTT for optimal migration performance is
    {{{max_rtt_ms}}} milliseconds.

  severity: WARNING
  message: >
    Warning while migrating VM with UUID '{{{vm_uuid}}}' because VM has floating IPs
    '{{{floating_ips}}}' assigned. Please ensure floating IPs are correctly configured
    for the VM on target AZ, failure to do so will affect external connectivity for the VM.

  severity: WARNING
  message: >
    Warning while migrating VM with UUID '{{{vm_uuid}}}' because VM is part of
    a PC based anti-affinity policy, which is not supported on target cluster
    with UUID '{{{target_cluster_uuid}}}'.
  arguments:
    - vm_uuid
    - target_cluster_uuid
- code: 32709
  errorGroup: MIGRATE_VM_WARNING
  severity: WARNING
  message: >
    Warning while migrating VM with UUID '{{{vm_uuid}}}' because VM has NGT mounted or
    installed but doesn't have an empty CD-ROM drive which is required to mount NGT ISO
    after migration, meaning VM on target cluster will be created without NGT installed.
