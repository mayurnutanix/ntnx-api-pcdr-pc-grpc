    description: >
      A virtual machine (VM) is a digital environment that operates as a virtual compute resource on a physical server. It uses software to run and deploy applications instead of a physical computer system. One server or host can have many VMs or guests running at the same time.
      The APIs under VM are used for creating and managing virtual machines on AHV.

      The APIs provide functionality to fetch statistics for AHV Virtual machines.
      Users can utilize the list/get VM stats APIs to retrieve comprehensive statistics, including specific metrics for disks and NICs attached to the VMs. The APIs support querying data within a specified time range by allowing users to specify start and end times.
      In addition, users can specify the sample interval, apply filters, and perform various aggregations such as AVG, SUM, COUNT, MIN, and MAX on the retrieved data.

    description: >
      The VM-VM anti-affinity policy is used to specify anti-affinity between the AHV virtual machines. The VM-VM anti-affinity policy keeps the specified virtual machines apart in such a way that when a problem occurs with one host, you should not lose both the virtual machines.
      The VM-VM anti-affinity policy APIs are used to manage these policies.
