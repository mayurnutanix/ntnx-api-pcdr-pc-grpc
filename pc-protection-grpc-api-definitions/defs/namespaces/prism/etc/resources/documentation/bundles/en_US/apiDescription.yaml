- name: "eligibleClusterListAPIDesc"
  value: |
    Get eligible PE(cluster) list to store PC backup. This list is returned to
    see what all PE's are eligible for the backup. Here eligible means that
    the version is greater than minimum required version. It is registered to
    the prism central.
- name: "addReplicasAPIDesc"
  value: |
    Adds a list of PE as part of replicas on which the backup is required to be
    taken. The maximum allowed replicas at a given moment is 3.
    If any one of the PE does not qualify for backup, then the API will fail.
- name: "removeReplicasAPIDesc"
  value: |
    Removes PE / ObjectStore from replicas. This will stop backup from being
    taken on PE / ObjectStore.
- name: "recoverPCApiDesc"
  value: |
    This is a task driven API. See the recovery sequence diagram in the design
    doc for the high level list of tasks. The work that this API is expected to
    do is listed below:
    1. getClusterExternalStateTrust from PE3. This should also get
    userrepository.
    2. restoreIDFData invocation from PCâ€™ to PE3
    3. Wait for above restore task to complete
    4. Restore Zk, filesystem data from IDF pc_zk_data table and
        pc_backup_specs table.
    5. Set reconcile services Zk flag /appliance/logical/prism/pcdr/recovery
    6. Start all processes on PC.
    7. Wait for 5 minutes - This is time given to services to recover. Fixed to
        5 mins.
- name: "getReplicasAPIDesc"
  value: |
    Retrieves the replica PE's from pc_backup_metadata table. Returns the
    uuid, name and lastSyncTimestamp to the user.
- name: "getRecoveryStatusAPIDesc"
  value: |
    Get status of recovery task. The object is returned which contains
    recoveryState and overallCompletionPercentage
- name: "restoreFilesApiDesc"
  value: |
    Restore files to the PC SVMs after the IDF data has been restored to the PC.
    This API will be called as part of recover task.
- name: "stopServicesApiDesc"
  value: |
    Stop services Api to stop some services using genesis on all the PC SVM Ip's
    This API will be called as part of recover task and will create a thread for
    stopping services on every SVM and will return a 202 response.
- name: "updateCredentialsAPIDesc"
  value: |
    Update Endpoint credentials API. This will update the corresponding access keys and
    secret access keys for a given entityId.
- name: "updateRpoAPIDesc"
  value: |
    Update RPO API will update the rpo value passed in seconds for a given entityId.
- name: "getFailedRecoveryPointsStatsAPIDesc"
  value: |
    Failed recovery stats api to list total failed recovery points in last 30 days and failure
    details i.e timestamp ,rpo and failure reason.
