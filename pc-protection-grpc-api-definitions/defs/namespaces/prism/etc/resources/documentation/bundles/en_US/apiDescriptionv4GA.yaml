- name: "CreateBackupTargetDescription"
  value: |
    Creates a cluster or object store as the backup target. For a given Prism Central,
    there can be up to 3 clusters as backup targets 
    and 1 object store as backup target. If any cluster or object store is not eligible for backup or 
    lacks appropriate permissions, the API request will fail. 
    For object store backup targets, specifying backup policy is mandatory along 
    with the location of the object store.

  value: |
    Retrieves the backup targets (cluster or object store) from a domain manager and returns the
    backup configuration and lastSyncTimestamp parameter to the user.

  value: |
    Updates the credentials and/or RPO of the given object store.
- name: "UpdateBackupTargetResponseDescription"
  value: |
    Returns the task ID corresponding to the update backup target request.
- name: "DeleteBackupTargetDescription"
  value: |
    Removes cluster/object store from the backup targets. This will stop the cluster/object store 
    from backing up Prism Central data.
- name: "DeleteBackupTargetResponseDescription"
  value: |
    Returns the task ID corresponding to the delete backup target request.
- name: "RestoreDomainManagerDescription"
  value: |
    The restore domain manager is a task-driven operation to restore a domain manager from a cluster or object store 
    backup location based on the selected restore point.
- name: "RestoreDomainManagerResponseDescription"
  value: |
    Returns a task reference object specifying a unique task ID corresponding to the restore operation.
- name: "GetRestoreInfoResponseDescription"
  value: |
    Returns the requested restore point details.
- name: "DomainManagerExtIdDescription"
  value: |
    A unique identifier for the domain manager.
- name: "ClusterExtIdDescription"
  value: |
    Cluster identifier
- name: "ManagementServerExtId"
  value: |
    Management server identifier
- name: "RegionNameDescription"
  value: |
    The region name of the object store endpoint where backup data of domain manager
    is stored.
- name: "ListRecoveryPointsDescription"
  value: |
    List all recovery points stats of a domain manager backed up at object store.
- name: "ListRestorePointsSummary"
  value: |
    List restore points
- name: "ListRestorePointsDescription"
  value: |
    The list restore points API allows you to retrieve a list of available restore points, 
    which are snapshots of the domain manager taken at different times.
    These restore points can be used to revert the domain manager to a previous state.
    The list response includes the creation time and identifier ID for the configuration data.<br> 
    1. For cluster-based backups, only the most recent restore point is available, as backups are continuous.<br>
    2. For object store-based backups, multiple restore points may be available, depending on the configured 
    Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and the retention period set on the s3 bucket.
- name: "ObjectStoreProviderDescription"
  value: |
    Object store provider represents the object store used to store backup and trigger recovery.
- name: "DeleteBackupTargetSummary"
  value: |
    Delete backup target
- name: "UpdateBackupTargetSummary"
  value: |
    Update backup target
- name: "CreateBackupTargetSummary"
  value: |
    Create backup target
- name: "GetRestorePointDetailsSummary"
  value: |
    Get restore point details
- name: "GetRestorePointDetailsDescription"
  value: |
    Retrieves detailed information about a specific recovery point and provides essential domain manager information
    stored in the backup, which is required for the restoration process.
- name: "RestoreDomainManagerSummary"
  value: |
    Restore domain manager
- name: "RestoreSourceExtIdDescription"
  value: |
    A unique identifier obtained from the restore source API that corresponds to the details provided for the 
    restore source.
- name: "ListRestorableDomainManagersDescription"
  value: |
    Lists all the domain managers backed up at the object store/cluster.
- name: "ListRestorableDomainManagersSummary"
  value: |
    List restorable domain managers
- name: "CreateRestoreSourceDescription"
  value: |
    Creates a restore source pointing to a cluster or object store to restore the domain manager. The created 
    restore source is intended to be deleted after use. If the restore source is
    not deleted using the deleteRestoreSource API, then it is auto-deleted after sometime. Also note that a restore 
    source will not contain a backup policy. It is only used to access the backup data at the location from where 
    the Prism Central may be restored. Credentials used to access the restore source are not validated at the time 
    of creation of the restore source. They are validated when the restore source is used to fetch data.
- name: "CreateRestoreSourceSummary"
  value: |
    Create restore source
- name: "LocationHeaderDesc"
  value: |
    Response header specifying the location of a newly created resource.
